⚠️  CRITICAL COINBASE AUTHENTICATION NOTICE
===========================================

The current credentials in credentials.py are Ed25519 format:
- COINBASE_API_KEY_ID = "2636c881-b44e-4263-b05d-fb10a5ad1836" 
- COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY = Ed25519 format (base64)

However, Coinbase Advanced Trading SDK requires ECDSA format:
- Must use "Advanced Settings" → "ECDSA" when creating API key
- Private key format: -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----

CURRENT SITUATION:
❌ Current credentials are Ed25519 (will fail with SDK)
✅ Need new ECDSA credentials from Coinbase Portal

TO FIX:
1. Go to https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api
2. Create new API key
3. Click "Advanced Settings"
4. Select "ECDSA" (NOT Ed25519)
5. Download JSON file
6. Update cdp_api_key.json with real credentials

The test script will show authentication failure until proper ECDSA credentials are provided.
