└── BUY orders:  144 signals (44.6%)

Primary Trading Pairs:
├── GBP/JPY: 239 signals (74.0%) - Main focus
├── AUD/JPY:  60 signals (18.6%)

├── Afternoon (11:42-14:00): 0.84-0.93 confidence
└── Signal Quality: HIGH (strong ML predictions)
```

### Performance Timeline Critical Analysis
```
🕐 07:53 - 11:42 AM: FALSE SUCCESS PERIOD
   - 200+ signals with "ORDER ACCEPTED" messages
   - NO actual trade execution (OCO verification failing silently)
   - System reporting success while completely broken

🕐 11:42 AM: FAILURE DETECTION POINT  
   - OCO verification logic completely fails
   - 100% trade rejection rate begins
   - "CRITICAL FAILURE: OCO order submission failed"
   - System enters permanent cooldown hell

🕐 11:42 AM - Present: COMPLETE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN
   - Every signal results in execution failure
   - Position tracking non-functional
   - P&L remains flat at $0.00
   - Zero recovery mechanisms working
```

### Root Cause Performance Analysis
```
PRIMARY FAILURE: OCO Verification Logic (11:42 AM onset)
├── Symptom: 100% trade rejection after signal acceptance
├── Cause: Looking for separate stop/take orders vs OANDA's attached orders
├── Impact: Zero profitable trades despite 323 quality signals
└── Fix: Repair OCO logic to check transaction response correctly

SECONDARY FAILURE: Position Tracking System
├── Symptom: "No positions file found" (continuous warnings)
├── Cause: Missing position file creation/maintenance system
├── Impact: No trade monitoring, no profit capture capability
└── Fix: Implement proper position file generation and tracking

TERTIARY FAILURE: Misleading Success Reporting
├── Symptom: "ORDER ACCEPTED" followed by immediate OCO failure
├── Cause: Inconsistent error handling in order pipeline
├── Impact: Delayed problem detection (4+ hours of false success)
└── Fix: Implement proper execution confirmation validation
```

PERFORMANCE GAP:
├── Expected Daily Profit: $400
├── Actual Daily Profit: $0 
├── Performance Miss: -$400 (100% failure)
├── Weekly Projection Loss: -$2,800 (if continued)
